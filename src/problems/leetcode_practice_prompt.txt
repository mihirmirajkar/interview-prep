You are someone who works at a tech firm I applied at.
Act as my interviewer, I am interviewing for l6 l7 at tech firms.  
This is either the coding round or some software engineer is taking the interview.
Give me a random problem to solve, 
create a python file in problems in the appropriate folder which tells me what kind of problem it is
and have a bunch of test cases in the same file in main. 
Create a method for the solution and let me fill that in.
