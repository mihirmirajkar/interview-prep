Problem: Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock
Difficulty: Easy
Category: Arrays
URL: https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock/

You are given an array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day.
You want to maximize your profit by choosing a single day to buy one stock and choosing a different day in the future to sell that stock.
Return the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction. If you cannot achieve any profit, return 0.
